## Program List with Description
*keras_mnist_fashion.py* - MNIST dataset for simple image classification from TensorFlow tutorial\
                           *Overfitting problem to be solved*\
                           Issue- If you reduce the number of neurons in the dense layer, the training accucracy goes down but the Test accuracy also goes down.\
                                  So it is neccesary to try someother technique.
 \
 \
 *keras_mnist_fashion_overfit_timeDecay.py* - MNIIST Fashion with inverse time deay of learning rate.\
                                              We will see it does not work even for a single hidden layer network.\
                                              Some plotting is also done to familiarize with plotting using the *History* object.
